# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?

Python was my first language and it is a lot smoother than Java in my opinion. You don't need to specify if a variable is int/str or something else due to how Python interprets them. 

2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.

I completed the assignments myself, but if I got stuck, I'd ask the AI for pointers rather than just the answer. It taught me about certain built in functions and helped refresh me on Python syntax.

3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?

It was useful to have a refresher on 2D arrays and dictionary usages, the AI helped explain them and give me directions on solving my problems. I also didn't understand what Duck Duck Goose wanted me to do at first, so it helped explain the problem.

4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?

I think that attempting the problem first and then asking if the thought process I used was good helped. Then I'd follow up afterward after correcting the thought process if necessary, by asking it to give me pointers on my code itself. It also helped a lot in defining the problem when I was misunderstanding the problem itself.
